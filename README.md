# TeslaGPT

## TeslaGPT is a smart assistant powered by GPT-4.

It uses `Web Speech API` to transcribe audio into text which is fed as a prompt to the `OpenAI API` model `GPT-3.5`

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> This is a Work in Progress (WIP).</h1>

### Features

Currently, TeslaGPT supports prompting the API through a form and then a value returning underneath the form.
